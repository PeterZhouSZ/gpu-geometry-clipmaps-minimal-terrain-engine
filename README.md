> Minimal implementation of the original Siggraph Paper in 200 lines of code
> 
> After browsing the web for a usable terrain lib, I ended up writing a new one as the others were too bloated.
>
> The result is a minimal implementation of the original of Geometry ClipMaps: Terrain rendering using nested regular grids in only 200 lines. Performance is around 1000-2000 fps.
